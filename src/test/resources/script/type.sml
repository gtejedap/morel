(*) Record and tuple are equivalent.
{1 = "a", 2 = true};
("a", true);
("a", true) = {1 = "a", 2 = true};
{1 = "a", 2 = true} = ("a", true);
("a", true) = {2 = true, 1 = "a"};
("a", true) = {2 = true, 1 = "b"};
("a", false) = {1 = "a", 2 = true};

(*) Empty record and empty tuple are equivalent, and of type 'unit'.
{};
();
{} = ();
() = {};

(*) Pattern-match on record
fun f {a = c, b} = b + c;
f {a = 5, b = 6};

fun f2 {a = 1, b} = b * 2
  | f2 {a, b} = b * 3;
f2 {a = 1, b = 6};
f2 {a = 2, b = 6};

fun f3 {a = 1, b} = b * 2;
f3 {a = 1, b = 6};

(*) The following correctly throws
(*)   unbound variable or constructor: a
(*) Disabled because error stacks made tests brittle.
(*) fun f4 {a = 1, b} = a + b;

(*) Variable with polymorphic type
val x = List.map;
x String.explode ["ab", "c"];

(*) Has polymorphic type
val rec len = fn x =>
    case x of head :: tail => 1 + (len tail)
            | [] => 0;

len [];
len [1];
len [1,2];

List.map len (List.map String.explode ["ab", "", "cde"]);
List.map (fn s => len (String.explode s)) ["ab", "", "cde"];

(*) Type resolution involving record selectors
val emps =
  [{id = 100, name = "Fred", deptno = 10},
   {id = 101, name = "Velma", deptno = 20},
   {id = 102, name = "Shaggy", deptno = 30},
   {id = 103, name = "Scooby", deptno = 30}];
map #deptno emps;
map #deptno (List.filter (fn e => #deptno e > 10) emps);
map #2 [(1,2),(3,1)];
List.filter #1 [(true,1),(false,2),(true,3)];
map #2 (List.filter #1 [(true,1),(false,2),(true,3)]);

(*) Should give
(*)  Error: duplicate variable in pattern(s): e
(*
fun in_ e [] = false
  | in_ e e :: tl = true
  | in_ e hd :: tl = in_ e tl
*)

(*) Should give
(*) Error: operator and operand don't agree [tycon mismatch]
(*)     operator domain: 'Z list list
(*)     operand:         (({id:'X; 'Y} -> 'X) * ([+ ty] * [+ ty] -> [+ ty])) list
(*)     in expression:

  fun computeAgg (extractor, folder) list =
      foldl folder (map extractor list);
